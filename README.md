# btc-live

Minimal single-file HTML demo that displays a live Bitcoin-themed visual experience intended to run continuously in the background.

The project is intentionally kept simple and dependency-free, focusing on clarity, fast loading, and ease of deployment.

---

## Purpose

This project was built as a lightweight demo to:
- Create a continuously running visual page related to Bitcoin
- Explore simple front-end behavior without frameworks
- Validate a minimal MVP before modularization

---

## Design Decisions

- Single-file HTML by design
- No external build tools or frameworks
- Assets optimized to meet static hosting constraints
- Simplicity prioritized over abstraction

A more modular structure can be introduced if the project evolves beyond a demo or MVP stage.

---

## Scope

In scope:
- Static HTML execution
- Background visual playback
- Minimal logic for timing and display

Out of scope:
- Backend services
- User interaction
- Analytics or tracking

---

## Notes

This repository represents an early-stage MVP / demo and serves as a foundation for further experimentation if needed.
